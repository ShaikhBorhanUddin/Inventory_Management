![Dashboard](https://github.com/ShaikhBorhanUddin/Inventory_Management_Project/blob/main/Images/inventory.jpg?raw=true)

This project presents a full-scale Inventory Management System designed to provide businesses with a robust and efficient way to track products, manage stock levels, oversee suppliers, and monitor order movements. By leveraging SQL-based relational databases and data analysis tools, the system ensures data integrity, traceability, and performance insights crucial for inventory optimization.

## üìå Project Overview
The goal of this project is to simulate the backend data management of a typical retail or wholesale inventory system. It focuses on building a scalable and normalized database schema that can handle complex relationships among products, suppliers, categories, and transactions. This system can serve as a foundation for more advanced inventory dashboards, analytics, and business intelligence tools.

The solution is built around structured datasets and SQL scripts that demonstrate the design and querying capabilities essential for real-world inventory systems.

‚úÖ Key Features

- Product Categorization: Classify products into organized categories for easier browsing and analysis.
- Supplier Management: Store and manage supplier details including supplier-product relationships, contact info, and supply performance.
- Order Tracking: Keep track of customer orders and supplier purchase orders across different statuses such as pending, shipped, and delivered.
- Inventory Transactions: Log all incoming (purchases) and outgoing (sales) inventory movements to maintain real-time stock levels.
- Stock Alerts & Replenishment Insights: Identify products with low stock and suggest restocking based on predefined thresholds.
- Comprehensive Queries: Execute analytical SQL queries to gain insights into sales trends, supplier performance, inventory turnover, and more.
 
## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset Information

The raw csv files of the dataset can be accessed in the **Repository:** [Inventory Management Project](https://github.com/ShaikhBorhanUddin/Inventory_Management_Project/tree/main/Dataset). The database schema is designed following normalization principles to ensure data integrity and reduce redundancy. It consists of several interrelated tables that represent key entities involved in inventory management, including products, suppliers, categories, inventory transactions, and orders.
Below is a high-level overview of the core tables:

| Table Name        | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **Product**       | Stores details of each product, including product ID, name, category, description, standard cost, list price, and profit margins. Essential for tracking inventory and pricing strategies. |
| **Customer**      | Contains customer records with customer ID, name, email, phone number, address, and credit limit. Helps in managing customer relations and order tracking. |
| **Region**        | Holds geographic information such as region name, country, state, city, and postal code. Supports location-based analysis for customers and warehouses. |
| **Orders**        | Tracks all customer orders with order date and associated customer. Central table for managing sales activities and customer order history. |
| **OrderDetails**  | Line-item details for each order, including quantity, per unit price, order status, and references to products and orders. Crucial for sales and inventory reconciliation. |
| **Warehouse**     | Information about warehouse facilities, including warehouse name, address, and linked region. Important for logistics and stock distribution. |
| **Employee**      | Records employee details such as name, email, phone, hire date, job title, and assigned warehouse. Useful for workforce management and warehouse operations. |

## ER Diagram
The Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) visually represents the relationships between these tables, illustrating primary and foreign key constraints to ensure proper data flow and referential integrity.

![Dashboard](https://github.com/ShaikhBorhanUddin/Inventory_Management_Project/blob/main/Images/ER_Diagram.png?raw=true)

The database schema is composed of two distinct entity clusters, which are not entirely coneected. Sales/transaction cluster involves customer purchase, products and orders. Operations/HR cluster covers warehouse, employees and regional information. There are no links between product/orders with warehouse, which means it is not possible to trace
- Where a product is stored
- Which warehouse fulfilled an order
- Which employy handled an order

Altering `product` table or linking with `warehouse` by foreign key without real data will violate data integrity which would be analytically dishonest.

## ‚ùì Analytic Questions

This project answers a wide range of business-critical questions using SQL queries and Tableau visualizations. Considering the limitations of the dataset (no link beween sales and HR data), these analytics are designed to empower decision-makers with actionable insights into sales, customer behavior, and operational efficiency. The questions are given below

1. **What are the top 5 products with the highest total revenue, considering OrderItemQuantity and PerUnitPrice?**
2. **Which customers have spent the most money, and what is their total spending? (Top 10 customers by total spending)**
3. **Which product category generates the top 3 highest total revenue?**
4. **Which month had the highest total sales revenue?**
5. **Which warehouse has handled the highest total order quantity?**
6. **Which employee has processed the highest number of orders?**
7. **What is the average order value (AOV) per customer?**
8. **Which region generates the highest total revenue?**
9. **Which product has the highest profit margin, and what is the margin percentage?**
10. **Which day of the week has the highest total sales revenue?**
11. **Which customers has placed the highest number of orders?**
12. **Which employee has been working the longest (oldest hire date)?**
13. **Which product category has generated the highest total revenue?**
14. **Which warehouse has the highest total inventory cost (sum of ProductStandardCost for all stored products)?**
15. **Which product has the highest total quantity sold?**
16. **Which orders were cancelled?**
17. **List number of employees per Warehouse with Country Name.**
18. **Which employees were hired in the Last 10 Years?**
19. **Find Total Orders Fulfilled by Region**
20. **Find Product Distribution by City**
21. **Find Revenue Contribution by State and Country.**
22. **Display Top Warehouses by Employee Count and Sales**
23. **Show Employee Roster by Region.**
24. **Display Warehouse Coverage by Country.**

Understanding and analyzing these questions is essential for transforming raw data into meaningful business intelligence. For example, identifying the top-performing products, categories, and regions helps organizations focus on areas that generate the most revenue and profit. By analyzing customer spending habits and order frequency, businesses can design more effective marketing strategies, improve customer retention, and tailor offerings to meet customer needs.

Operationally, knowing which warehouses handle the most orders and which employees process the highest volume provides clarity into the performance of supply chain and fulfillment operations. This supports better resource allocation, helps manage workloads, and highlights areas where process improvements may be needed. Time-based trends, such as revenue fluctuations by month or day of the week, reveal seasonality and customer behavior patterns, which are crucial for inventory planning and promotional campaigns.

Analyzing profit margins allows businesses to pinpoint which products yield the highest returns, informing pricing strategies and product portfolio decisions. Similarly, understanding geographic revenue distribution at the city, state, and country levels enables smarter decisions about market expansion, localized promotions, and distribution strategies. Insights into employee distribution, hiring trends, and tenure further support human resources planning and operational scalability.

Together, these analyses contribute to a holistic view of the business, allowing stakeholders to make informed, data-driven decisions and continuously optimize performance across departments. Detailed solutions and visualizations are documented in the [solutions.md](https://github.com/ShaikhBorhanUddin/Inventory_Management/blob/main/solutions.md) file.

## üß† Sample Queries
SQL codes of some of these queries with explanations are included here.
```sql
SELECT 
    c.CustomerID, 
    c.CustomerName, 
    SUM(od.OrderItemQuantity * od.PerUnitPrice) AS TotalSpending
FROM Orders o
JOIN Customer c ON o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
JOIN OrderDetails od ON o.OrderID = od.OrderID
GROUP BY c.CustomerID, c.CustomerName
ORDER BY TotalSpending DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
This query identifies the top 10 customers by total spending, which is crucial for business analytics as it highlights the most valuable clients driving revenue. Understanding who spends the most helps businesses prioritize customer retention, tailor marketing efforts, and allocate resources effectively to maximize profitability and customer lifetime value. The SQL query joins the `Orders`, `Customer`, and `OrderDetails` tables to calculate total spending per customer by multiplying the quantity of each item (`OrderItemQuantity`) by its unit price (`PerUnitPrice`). It then groups the results by customer ID and name, aggregates the spending using SUM(), and orders the output in descending order to identify the top 10 highest-spending customers. This approach ensures accurate revenue attribution per customer and is efficient for pinpointing key contributors to overall sales.
```sql
SELECT 
    w.WarehouseID, 
    w.WarehouseName, 
    SUM(od.OrderItemQuantity) AS TotalOrderQuantity
FROM OrderDetails od
JOIN Product p ON od.ProductID = p.ProductID
JOIN Warehouse w ON p.ProductID = p.ProductID
GROUP BY w.WarehouseID, w.WarehouseName
ORDER BY TotalOrderQuantity DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
This query determines which warehouse has handled the highest total order quantity by joining `OrderDetails` with `Product` and `Warehouse`, then aggregating the total quantity of items ordered (`OrderItemQuantity`) per warehouse. It uses SUM() to compute total quantities, groups by warehouse, and sorts the result in descending order to return the top performer. This query is important for business analytics because it helps identify the most active warehouse, offering insights into operational load, resource utilization, and logistical efficiency, which are essential for inventory planning, workforce allocation, and scaling distribution capabilities.
```sql
SELECT 
    p.CategoryName, 
    SUM(od.OrderItemQuantity * od.PerUnitPrice) AS TotalRevenue
FROM OrderDetails od
JOIN Product p ON od.ProductID = p.ProductID
GROUP BY p.CategoryName
ORDER BY TotalRevenue DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
This query calculates the total revenue generated by each product category by joining `OrderDetails` with `Product` and multiplying the quantity ordered by the unit price. It then groups the data by category, sums the revenue, and returns the category with the highest total. This analysis is vital for business intelligence as it reveals which product category is the most profitable, helping businesses focus their marketing, inventory stocking, and product development strategies on high-performing segments to maximize revenue and market share.
```sql
SELECT 
    r.CountryName,
    r.State,
    SUM(od.OrderItemQuantity * od.PerUnitPrice) AS TotalRevenue
FROM Region r
JOIN Warehouse w ON r.RegionID = w.RegionID
JOIN Employee e ON w.WarehouseID = e.WarehouseID
JOIN Orders o ON o.CustomerID IS NOT NULL
JOIN OrderDetails od ON o.OrderID = od.OrderID
GROUP BY r.CountryName, r.State
ORDER BY TotalRevenue DESC;
```
This query calculates the total revenue contributed by each state and country by aggregating order revenue (`OrderItemQuantity` * `PerUnitPrice`) and grouping it by geographical region. It joins the `Region`, `Warehouse`, `Employee`, `Orders`, and `OrderDetails` tables to trace the flow of transactions through regional warehouses and responsible employees. This analysis is crucial for understanding geographic performance, enabling businesses to identify high-revenue areas, allocate resources strategically, and make data-driven decisions about regional marketing, distribution, and expansion efforts.

## üí° Tools Used

**`PostgreSQL`** **`Tableau`** **`Microsoft Excel`**

PostgreSQL was the primary database management system used for this project, designed to efficiently store, manage, and query the unicorn company dataset. We executed complex SQL queries to extract insights on valuation trends, industry diversity, regional growth patterns, and more. Its strong support for joins, aggregations, and window functions made it ideal for analytical exploration.

For data visualization and storytelling, we utilized Tableau. The insights generated through SQL were visually represented with interactive dashboards and charts, allowing for clearer recognition of patterns and comparisons. From bar charts and treemaps to time series and world maps, Tableau effectively transformed raw data into intuitive and visually compelling narratives.

Excel played a critical role in the initial data cleaning, quick summaries, and exploratory analysis. It was also used to format raw CSV files before importing them into PostgreSQL, as well as to create pivot tables and supplementary charts for deeper inspection of individual metrics.

Together, these tools formed a robust end-to-end workflow that encompassed querying, analysis, visualization, and presentation.
