![Dashboard](https://github.com/ShaikhBorhanUddin/Inventory_Management_Project/blob/main/Images/inventory.jpg?raw=true)

This project presents a full-scale Inventory Management System designed to provide businesses with a robust and efficient way to track products, manage stock levels, oversee suppliers, and monitor order movements. By leveraging SQL-based relational databases and data analysis tools, the system ensures data integrity, traceability, and performance insights crucial for inventory optimization.

## üìå Project Overview
The goal of this project is to simulate the backend data management of a typical retail or wholesale inventory system. It focuses on building a scalable and normalized database schema that can handle complex relationships among products, suppliers, categories, and transactions. This system can serve as a foundation for more advanced inventory dashboards, analytics, and business intelligence tools.

The solution is built around structured datasets and SQL scripts that demonstrate the design and querying capabilities essential for real-world inventory systems.

‚úÖ Key Features

- Product Categorization: Classify products into organized categories for easier browsing and analysis.
- Supplier Management: Store and manage supplier details including supplier-product relationships, contact info, and supply performance.
- Order Tracking: Keep track of customer orders and supplier purchase orders across different statuses such as pending, shipped, and delivered.
- Inventory Transactions: Log all incoming (purchases) and outgoing (sales) inventory movements to maintain real-time stock levels.
- Stock Alerts & Replenishment Insights: Identify products with low stock and suggest restocking based on predefined thresholds.
- Comprehensive Queries: Execute analytical SQL queries to gain insights into sales trends, supplier performance, inventory turnover, and more.
 
## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset Information

The raw csv files of the dataset can be accessed in the **Repository:** [Inventory Management Project](https://github.com/ShaikhBorhanUddin/Inventory_Management_Project/tree/main/Dataset). The database schema is designed following normalization principles to ensure data integrity and reduce redundancy. It consists of several interrelated tables that represent key entities involved in inventory management, including products, suppliers, categories, inventory transactions, and orders.
Below is a high-level overview of the core tables:

| Table Name        | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **Product**       | Stores details of each product, including product ID, name, category, description, standard cost, list price, and profit margins. Essential for tracking inventory and pricing strategies. |
| **Customer**      | Contains customer records with customer ID, name, email, phone number, address, and credit limit. Helps in managing customer relations and order tracking. |
| **Region**        | Holds geographic information such as region name, country, state, city, and postal code. Supports location-based analysis for customers and warehouses. |
| **Orders**        | Tracks all customer orders with order date and associated customer. Central table for managing sales activities and customer order history. |
| **OrderDetails**  | Line-item details for each order, including quantity, per unit price, order status, and references to products and orders. Crucial for sales and inventory reconciliation. |
| **Warehouse**     | Information about warehouse facilities, including warehouse name, address, and linked region. Important for logistics and stock distribution. |
| **Employee**      | Records employee details such as name, email, phone, hire date, job title, and assigned warehouse. Useful for workforce management and warehouse operations. |

## ER Diagram
The Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) visually represents the relationships between these tables, illustrating primary and foreign key constraints to ensure proper data flow and referential integrity.

![Dashboard](https://github.com/ShaikhBorhanUddin/Inventory_Management_Project/blob/main/Images/ER_Diagram.png?raw=true)

The ER diagram (figure above) illustrates a relational database schema composed of two separate clusters: the Sales/Transaction cluster and the Operations/HR cluster, which operate independently without any direct links between them. The Sales/Transaction cluster includes tables such as `customer`, `orders`, `orderdetails`, and `product`, capturing customer profiles, order transactions, product listings, and sales data. The Operations/HR cluster consists of `region`, `warehouse`, and `employee` tables, which provide information about geographic regions, warehouse infrastructure, and employee assignments. However, there are no foreign key relationships connecting these two clusters. Consequently, the database lacks the ability to answer key operational questions such as: where a product is stored, which warehouse fulfilled a specific order, or which employee was responsible for processing or managing it. While it might be tempting to modify the schema‚Äîfor example, by linking the product table to the warehouse table or the orders table to employee‚Äîdoing so without actual transactional or inventory data would violate data integrity principles and introduce analytically dishonest assumptions. Maintaining the current separation ensures accuracy and transparency in analysis, even if it limits certain operational insights.

## ‚ùì Analytic Questions

This project answers a wide range of business-critical questions using SQL queries and Tableau visualizations. Considering the limitations of the dataset (no link beween sales and HR data), these analytics are designed to empower decision-makers with actionable insights into sales, customer behavior, and operational efficiency. The questions are given below

1. **What are the top 5 products with the highest total revenue, considering OrderItemQuantity and PerUnitPrice?**
2. **Which customers have spent the most money, and what is their total spending? (Top 10 customers by total spending)**
3. **Which product category generates the top 3 highest total revenue?**
4. **Which month had the highest total sales revenue?**
5. **What is the average order value (AOV) for top 15 customers?**
6. **Which product has the highest profit margin, and what is the margin percentage?**
7. **Which day of the week has the highest total sales revenue?**
8. **Which employee has been working the longest (oldest hire date)?**
9. **Which product has the highest total quantity sold and how much profit is generated?**
10. **Show employee distribution among countries.**
11. **Which employees were hired in the Last 10 Years?**
12. **Find Revenue Contribution by State and Country.**
13. **Display Warehouse Coverage by Country.**

Understanding and analyzing these questions is essential for transforming raw data into meaningful business intelligence. These 13 business analytics questions, while shaped by the limitations of the available dataset, are crucial for gaining actionable insights across key operational areas‚Äîsales, customer behavior, product performance, employee data, and geographic distribution. They help businesses identify top-performing products, high-value customers, and revenue-driving categories, which are vital for strategic product placement and marketing. Questions on average order value, profit margins, and time-based sales trends offer guidance for pricing strategies and demand forecasting. Employee-related insights support HR planning and regional workforce analysis, while geographical revenue and warehouse data assist in optimizing logistics, supply chains, and expansion decisions. Despite potential gaps in data completeness or granularity, these questions align closely with core metrics that drive informed decision-making and competitive advantage.

Together, these analyses contribute to a holistic view of the business, allowing stakeholders to make informed, data-driven decisions and continuously optimize performance across departments. Detailed solutions and visualizations are documented in the [solutions.md](https://github.com/ShaikhBorhanUddin/Inventory_Management/blob/main/solutions.md) file.

## üß† Sample Queries
SQL codes of some of these queries with explanations are included here.
```sql
SELECT 
    TO_CHAR(o.OrderDate, 'YYYY-MM') AS OrderMonth, 
    SUM(od.OrderItemQuantity * od.PerUnitPrice) AS TotalRevenue
FROM Orders o
JOIN OrderDetails od ON o.OrderID = od.OrderID
GROUP BY OrderMonth
ORDER BY TotalRevenue DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
This SQL query identifies the month with the highest total sales revenue. It joins the `Orders` table with the `OrderDetails` table using the `OrderID` key to access detailed order information. The `OrderDate` is formatted as `'YYYY-MM'` using the `TO_CHAR` function to group revenue data by month. For each month, it calculates total revenue by multiplying the quantity of items ordered (`OrderItemQuantity`) by the unit price (`PerUnitPrice`) and summing these values. The query groups results by OrderMonth, orders them in descending order of revenue, and uses LIMIT 1 to return only the month with the highest revenue.

```sql
SELECT 
    c.CustomerID, 
    c.CustomerName, 
    AVG(od.OrderItemQuantity * od.PerUnitPrice) AS AvgOrderValue
FROM Orders o
JOIN Customer c ON o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
JOIN OrderDetails od ON o.OrderID = od.OrderID
GROUP BY c.CustomerID, c.CustomerName
ORDER BY AvgOrderValue DESC
LIMIT 15;
```
This SQL query calculates the Average Order Value (AOV) for each customer and retrieves the top 15 customers with the highest AOV. It joins three tables: `Orders`, `Customer`, and `OrderDetails`. The join connects customer IDs to their orders and links each order to its detailed items. The query computes the average value of all order items for each customer by multiplying the quantity of items ordered (`OrderItemQuantity`) with their unit price (`PerUnitPrice`) and applying the `AVG` function. The results are grouped by customer and sorted in descending order of AOV, returning the top 15 highest-spending customers by average transaction value.

```sql
SELECT 
    TO_CHAR(OrderDate, 'Day') AS DayOfWeek, 
    SUM(od.OrderItemQuantity * od.PerUnitPrice) AS TotalRevenue
FROM Orders o
JOIN OrderDetails od ON o.OrderID = od.OrderID
GROUP BY DayOfWeek
ORDER BY TotalRevenue DESC;
```
This query calculates the total sales revenue for each day of the week by aggregating the revenue generated from all orders. It first converts the `OrderDate` into the day of the week name using the `TO_CHAR` function, labeling it as `DayOfWeek`. Then, it joins the `Orders` table with `OrderDetails` to access the quantity and price of each order item. For each day, it sums the product of `OrderItemQuantity` and `PerUnitPrice` to compute the total revenue. The results are grouped by day of the week and ordered in descending order of total revenue, helping identify which day generates the highest sales.

```sql
SELECT 
    p.ProductID, 
    p.ProductName, 
    SUM(od.OrderItemQuantity) AS TotalQuantitySold,
    SUM(od.OrderItemQuantity * p.Profit) AS TotalProfit
FROM OrderDetails od
JOIN Product p ON od.ProductID = p.ProductID
GROUP BY p.ProductID, p.ProductName
ORDER BY TotalQuantitySold DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
This SQL query retrieves the top 10 products based on the total quantity sold, along with the total profit generated from those sales. It joins the `OrderDetails` table with the `Product` table using the `ProductID` to match each order item to its product details. The `SUM(od.OrderItemQuantity)` calculates the total number of units sold for each product, while `SUM(od.OrderItemQuantity * p.Profit)` computes the total profit by multiplying the number of units sold with the per-unit profit of each product. The results are grouped by product ID and name to aggregate values per product, then sorted in descending order of quantity sold, and finally, only the top 10 records are displayed. This helps in identifying the most sold and most profitable products.

## ‚úÖ Future Improvements

To enhance the functionality and usability of the Inventory Management System, several future improvements are planned. These include implementing automated triggers to ensure real-time stock updates, which will improve inventory accuracy and operational efficiency. A front-end dashboard integration is also envisioned to provide interactive visualizations and easier access to key metrics for stakeholders. Additionally, incorporating stored procedures will help streamline complex transactions and enforce consistent business logic at the database level. Finally, expanding the system‚Äôs reporting capabilities‚Äîsuch as generating monthly stock summaries and evaluating supplier performance‚Äîwill support deeper business insights and data-driven decision-making.

## üí° Tools Used

**`PostgreSQL`** **`Tableau`** **`Microsoft Excel`**

PostgreSQL was the primary database management system used for this project, designed to efficiently store, manage, and query the unicorn company dataset. We executed complex SQL queries to extract insights on valuation trends, industry diversity, regional growth patterns, and more. Its strong support for joins, aggregations, and window functions made it ideal for analytical exploration.

For data visualization and storytelling, we utilized Tableau. The insights generated through SQL were visually represented with interactive dashboards and charts, allowing for clearer recognition of patterns and comparisons. From bar charts and treemaps to time series and world maps, Tableau effectively transformed raw data into intuitive and visually compelling narratives.

Excel played a critical role in the initial data cleaning, quick summaries, and exploratory analysis. It was also used to format raw CSV files before importing them into PostgreSQL, as well as to create pivot tables and supplementary charts for deeper inspection of individual metrics.

Together, these tools formed a robust end-to-end workflow that encompassed querying, analysis, visualization, and presentation.
