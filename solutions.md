# Q9: Which product has the highest total quantity sold and how much profit is generated?

This question is crucial in Business Intelligence as it identifies the best-selling product by volume and evaluates the profit it brings to the business. While high sales volume often signals product popularity or market demand, it doesn't always equate to profitability. By also calculating the total profit, decision-makers can determine whether the product's success in quantity sold aligns with its contribution to financial performance. This insight helps optimize product strategies, such as inventory stocking, marketing focus, and pricing models, ensuring that top-selling items are also financially viable.

## Solution
```SQL
SELECT 
    p.ProductID, 
    p.ProductName, 
    SUM(od.OrderItemQuantity) AS TotalQuantitySold,
    SUM(od.OrderItemQuantity * p.Profit) AS TotalProfit
FROM OrderDetails od

    r.CountryName,
    COUNT(e.EmployeeID) AS EmployeeCount
FROM Warehouse w
JOIN Region r ON w.RegionID = r.RegionID
LEFT JOIN Employee e ON w.WarehouseID = e.WarehouseID
GROUP BY r.CountryName
ORDER BY EmployeeCount DESC;
```
This SQL query calculates the total number of employees per country by joining relevant tables. It first joins the `Warehouse` table with the `Region` table using the `RegionID` to retrieve each warehouseâ€™s associated country (`CountryName`). Then it uses a `LEFT JOIN` to link the `Employee` table on `WarehouseID`, ensuring all countries are includedâ€”even those with warehouses that have no employees. The query groups the results by `CountryName` and counts the number of employees (`EmployeeID`) in each country. The final result is ordered in descending order to display countries with the highest number of employees at the top.

## Output
|countryname              |employeecount|
|-------------------------|-------------|
|United States of America |178          |
|Australia                |45           |
|China                    |45           |
|Mexico                   |45           |
|Canada                   |44           |
|India                    |43           |

The query reveals that the United States of America has the highest number of employees among all countries, with a total of 178 employees. This is followed by Australia, China, and Mexico, each employing 45 individuals. Canada and India also contribute significantly to the workforce with 44 and 43 employees respectively. This distribution indicates a strong concentration of personnel in the U.S., likely reflecting a higher number of warehouses or larger operational scale in that region compared to others.

# Q11: Which employees were hired in the Last 10 Years?

Identifying employees hired in the last 10 years is crucial for understanding workforce trends, recent recruitment efforts, and organizational growth. It helps highlight how much of the current workforce consists of newer hires versus long-standing staff, offering insights into employee turnover, succession planning, and talent acquisition strategies. This information is particularly valuable for HR and management teams to assess hiring effectiveness, plan training programs, and ensure that the organization is maintaining a healthy balance between experienced and new talent.

## Solution
```sql
SELECT 
    EmployeeID,
    EmployeeName,
    EmployeeJobTitle,
    EmployeeHireDate,
    w.WarehouseName
FROM Employee e
JOIN Warehouse w ON e.WarehouseID = w.WarehouseID
WHERE EmployeeHireDate >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '10 year';
```
This SQL query retrieves information about employees who were hired within the last 10 years. It selects the `EmployeeID`, `EmployeeName`, `EmployeeJobTitle`, `EmployeeHireDate`, and the `WarehouseName` where each employee is assigned. The query joins the `Employee` table with the `Warehouse` table using the `WarehouseID` to associate each employee with their respective warehouse. The `WHERE` clause filters the results to include only those employees whose hire date is within the last 10 years from the current date, using the `CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '10 year'` condition. This helps in analyzing recent hiring patterns and identifying newly added staff across different warehouse locations.

## Output
|employeeid|employeename        |employeejobtitle               |employeehiredate|warehousename     |

# Q12: Find Revenue Contribution by State and Country.

Analyzing the revenue contribution by state and country is significant as it helps identify which geographic regions are driving the most business income, enabling strategic decision-making in marketing, resource allocation, and expansion planning. By understanding which states and countries contribute the highest revenue, the company can prioritize high-performing markets, address underperforming areas, and tailor its operations to regional demand. This insight also supports budgeting, sales forecasting, and helps optimize supply chain and distribution strategies for maximum profitability.

## Solution
```sql
SELECT 
    r.CountryName,
    r.State,
    SUM(od.OrderItemQuantity * od.PerUnitPrice) AS TotalRevenue
FROM Region r
JOIN Warehouse w ON r.RegionID = w.RegionID
JOIN Employee e ON w.WarehouseID = e.WarehouseID
JOIN Orders o ON o.CustomerID IS NOT NULL
JOIN OrderDetails od ON o.OrderID = od.OrderID
GROUP BY r.CountryName, r.State
ORDER BY TotalRevenue DESC;
```
This SQL query calculates the total revenue generated from orders, grouped by state and country. It starts by selecting the country name and state from the `Region` table, then joins it with the `Warehouse` table using `RegionID`, connects to the `Employee` table via `WarehouseID`, and links to the `Orders` table, ensuring only valid customer orders are considered (`CustomerID IS NOT NULL`). It further joins with the `OrderDetails` table to access the quantity and unit price of items ordered. The total revenue is computed by multiplying `OrderItemQuantity` by `PerUnitPrice` for each order, then summing these values. The results are grouped by country and state to aggregate revenue regionally and sorted in descending order to highlight top-performing regions.

## Output
|countryname              |state               |totalrevenue   |
|-------------------------|--------------------|---------------|
|Mexico                   |Distrito Federal    |1373404081.95  |
|United States of America |Washington          |1373404081.95  |
|United States of America |New Jersey          |1373404081.95  |
|Australia                |New South Wales     |1373404081.95  |
|China                    |Beijing             |1373404081.95  |
|United States of America |Texas               |1342883991.24  |
|Canada                   |Ontario             |1342883991.24  |
|United States of America |California          |1342883991.24  |
|India                    |Maharashtra         |1312363900.53  |

The revenue contribution analysis by state and country reveals that the highest total revenue, approximately 1.37 billion, was generated equally across several top-performing regions: Distrito Federal (Mexico), Washington and New Jersey (USA), New South Wales (Australia), and Beijing (China). These are followed by Texas, Ontario, and California, each contributing around 1.34 billion in revenue, and Maharashtra (India) with about 1.31 billion. This distribution indicates a strong and relatively balanced revenue performance among key states across multiple countries, suggesting a wide and effective geographic market presence.

# Q13: Display Warehouse Coverage by Country.

Understanding warehouse coverage by country is crucial for evaluating the geographic distribution and logistical efficiency of a company's supply chain. By identifying how many warehouses operate in each country, businesses can assess their ability to meet regional demand, reduce delivery times, and optimize inventory management. This insight also helps in strategic planning for expansion, identifying underserved regions, and ensuring balanced resource allocation across key markets, ultimately supporting better customer service and operational performance.

## Solution
```sql
SELECT 
    r.CountryName,
    COUNT(DISTINCT w.WarehouseID) AS NumberOfWarehouses
FROM Region r
JOIN Warehouse w ON r.RegionID = w.RegionID
GROUP BY r.CountryName;
```
This SQL query calculates the number of distinct warehouses operating in each country. It begins by selecting data from the `Region` table (aliased as `r`) and joins it with the `Warehouse` table (aliased as `w`) using the `RegionID` key, ensuring that each warehouse is correctly associated with its region and corresponding country. The query then uses `COUNT(DISTINCT w.WarehouseID)` to count the unique warehouses within each country, grouped by `CountryName`. The result is a summary table showing how many warehouses are present in each country, helping to analyze warehouse distribution across geographic locations.

## Output
|countryname             |numberofwarehouses|
|------------------------|------------------|
|Australia               |45                |
|Canada                  |44                |
|China                   |45                |
|India                   |43                |
|Mexico                  |45                |
|United States of America|178               |

The summary of warehouse coverage by country reveals that the United States has the highest number of warehouses, totaling 178, indicating a strong and widespread logistics network. Other countries like Australia, China, and Mexico each have 45 warehouses, showing balanced warehouse distribution in those regions. Canada follows closely with 44, while India has 43 warehouses, the lowest among the listed countries. This data highlights the geographic spread and infrastructure strength of the warehouse network across key international markets.
