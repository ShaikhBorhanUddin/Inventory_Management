# Q1: What are the top 5 products with the highest total revenue, considering OrderItemQuantity and PerUnitPrice?

The analytic question is crucial in the context of Business Intelligence (BI) because it enables data-driven decision-making related to product performance and profitability. By identifying which products contribute the most to overall revenue, businesses can prioritize inventory, optimize supply chain management, and tailor marketing strategies to promote high-performing items. This insight helps executives and managers allocate resources efficiently, forecast demand more accurately, and drive revenue growth by focusing on the most profitable product lines. In BI, such targeted analysis transforms raw transactional data into actionable business insights.

## Solution
```SQL
SELECT 
    p.ProductID, 
    p.ProductName, 
    SUM(od.OrderItemQuantity * od.PerUnitPrice) AS TotalRevenue
FROM OrderDetails od
JOIN Product p ON od.ProductID = p.ProductID
GROUP BY p.ProductID, p.ProductName
ORDER BY TotalRevenue DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
This SQL query identifies the **top 5 products that generate the highest total revenue** in the database. It does so by joining the `OrderDetails` table with the `Product` table using the `ProductID` key to access product names and prices. For each product, it calculates total revenue by multiplying the quantity of each item ordered (`OrderItemQuantity`) with its selling price (`PerUnitPrice`), and then summing this value across all orders. The `GROUP BY` clause groups the results by each product's ID and name to ensure accurate aggregation. Finally, the results are sorted in descending order of revenue using `ORDER BY TotalRevenue DESC`, and `LIMIT 5` returns only the top five highest-grossing products.

## Output

# Q8: Which product has the highest profit margin, and what is the margin percentage?

Understanding which product has the **highest profit margin** is essential in business intelligence because it directly informs profitability strategies. While total revenue shows which products sell the most, profit margin reveals which ones **yield the highest return per sale**. Identifying high-margin products helps businesses **prioritize marketing**, **inventory**, and **resource allocation** toward items that drive the most profit relative to cost. This insight supports strategic decision-making around product pricing, promotion, and portfolio optimization, ultimately enhancing overall financial performance and long-term growth.

## Solution
```SQL
SELECT 
    ProductID, 
    ProductName, 
    ROUND((Profit / ProductStandardCost) * 100, 2) AS ProfitMarginPercentage
FROM Product
ORDER BY ProfitMarginPercentage DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
This SQL query identifies the **product with the highest profit margin percentage**. It selects the `ProductID`, `ProductName`, and calculates the profit margin as a percentage by dividing the `Profit` by the `ProductStandardCost` and multiplying the result by 100. The `ROUND` function is used to round the margin percentage to two decimal places for better readability. The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the products in descending order based on their calculated `ProfitMarginPercentage`, and the `LIMIT 1` ensures that only the top product with the **highest margin** is returned. This analysis helps determine which product yields the **most efficient** profit relative to its cost.

## Output
|productid|productname                          |profitmarginpercentage|
|---------|-------------------------------------|----------------------|

# Q16: Which orders were cancelled?
## Solution
```sql
SELECT 
    p.ProductID, 
    p.ProductName, 
    COUNT(od.OrderDetailsID) AS ReturnCount, 
    od.OrderStatus
FROM OrderDetails od
JOIN Product p ON od.ProductID = p.ProductID
WHERE od.OrderStatus IN ('Canceled')
GROUP BY p.ProductID, p.ProductName, od.OrderStatus
ORDER BY ReturnCount DESC;
```

# Q19: Find Total Orders Fulfilled by Region
## Solution
```sql
SELECT 
    r.RegionID,
    r.RegionName,
    COUNT(o.OrderID) AS TotalOrders
FROM Region r
JOIN Warehouse w ON r.RegionID = w.RegionID
JOIN Employee e ON w.WarehouseID = e.WarehouseID
JOIN Orders o ON o.CustomerID IS NOT NULL  -- Simulate fulfillment (assuming all orders are handled)
GROUP BY r.RegionID, r.RegionName;
```
## Output
|regionid|regionname     |totalorders|
